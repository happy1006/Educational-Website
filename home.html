                    <p>Education gives us an understanding of the world around us and offers us an opportunity to use
                        that knowledge wisely. Irrespective of race, creed, and gender, education makes it possible for
                        people to stand out as equal with all the other persons from different walks of life. Overall,
                        education is the platform that makes it possible to defeat all barriers.....</p>
